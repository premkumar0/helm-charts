This repository is a personal initiative to provide Helm charts for the community. The code is provided as-is with no warranties. Community-driven features are not subject to official support.

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, you can add the repository as follows:

```
helm repo add pr-charts https://premkumar0.github.io/helm-charts
```

You can then run `helm search repo pr-charts` to see the available charts.
